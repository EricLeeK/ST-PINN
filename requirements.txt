# --- Core Deep Learning Framework ---
# NOTE: It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to install PyTorch first by following the
# official instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# This ensures you get the correct version for your hardware (CPU or CUDA).
# The line below will work, but may default to a CPU-only version.
torch>=2.0.0

# --- Scientific Computing & Data Handling ---
numpy>=1.23.0      # Fundamental package for numerical operations with arrays
scipy>=1.9.0       # Used for scientific tools, in this project specifically for loading .mat reference files (scipy.io)

# --- Plotting & Visualization ---
matplotlib>=3.6.0  # Used for generating all plots and result visualizations
